    <h1 class="page title">Jen Lewis Bitwise Industries Project Management Apprentice</h1>
    <p>Jen was a member of one of the specialized classes, meaning she was enrolled alongside other veterans, many of whom shared similar struggles as her. Being next to others who had also served was a community Jen found comforting. “Being around my brothers and sisters as I stepped into a new environment where I knew no one really helped my PTSD,” Jen shared. “We were already used to coming together as a team to accomplish a mission, so working together and helping each other was second nature to us.”

        That class was the perfect space for Jen to truly begin her new journey as a civilian. A comfortable space alongside people with familiar experiences, a newfound sense of purpose, and support from Bitwise along the way was the perfect combination to lay a new foundation in Jen’s life. “Bitwise paid for my classes, and gave me a spot in a paid internship after I proved that I had the grit, determination, and skill to do it.” Jen said. “I was selected for an apprenticeship and given the opportunity to work on the OnwardUS project. They even helped me navigate my housing assistance while learning this new career.”
        
        These days, Jen might not be jumping out of planes or traversing deserts, but she’s finding purpose in her new day-to-day work. Jen’s story is just one of many veterans, and she hopes the opportunity Bitwise gave her is one that other organizations will see and follow suit. The specialized course and apprenticeship program allowed her to get her foot in the door, and eventually fostered the  confidence and courage to open that door for herself and embark on a new career.</p>
        
        <p>More than anything, Jen is thankful that her experience with Bitwise has given her a new purpose in life. Our veteran community is one that should always be honored for their time serving our country, but it’s also our responsibility to take care of them when they return home. Alongside physical and mental care, helping veterans find purpose in their new lives as civilians can be the difference between just surviving and truly thriving.

            “I have a reason to get out of bed each morning,” Jen said. “I have hope for a better future instead of just surviving the day. I actually believe that I have a future worth sticking around for.
