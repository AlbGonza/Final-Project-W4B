    <h1>Where Your Future Starts</h1>
    <p>It’s not, and never was, just the history of Bitwise – it’s the story of countless people, of a community, of a city that would not settle for less than it deserved. That’s some powerful knowledge, but it’s meaningless without the agreement to work your ass off. So, that’s what we’ve been doing. With no more excuses, we’ve spent each day, month, and year igniting a revolution – not just of technology, but of self-imposed limitations.</p>

                    <p>These classes give you so many more opportunities than just being a coder. You have the skills and the knowledge, which gives you advantages in other places as well – it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to end up being a coder -Ian Garoian </p>
